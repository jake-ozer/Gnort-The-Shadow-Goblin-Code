# Gnort-The-Shadow-Goblin-Code
A collection of scripts I created while making the prototype of a 2d platformer called "Gnort: The Shadow Goblin", as well as scripts from an untitled project involving a 2d mystery game.

Feel free to take a look at some of the stuff I programmed for my various projects! Each file has a description of what the script does and how it functions.
